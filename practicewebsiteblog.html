<!-- 

    $("button").on("click", function() {
      alert("clicked!")
    });

How this works:

The syntax for using the .on() is as follows: 
    
    $(selector).on(event, function)

- $("button"): This is a jQuery object that selects the HTML elements we want to attatch the event handler to. The selector goes inside ("") and has a $ in front. $(""). Eg we could select $("h1").

- .on(): The syntax for using the .on() is as follows: $(selector).on(event, function). 


- $() is the selector that chooses the element to listen to. In this case, it's "button"
- .on() function sets up an event listener for the element we selected
- "click" is the type of event we are lisening for
- function (): the action to take when the event happens

$ is a jQuery
